about_title: Intro
about_content: |
  I've been working as a mobile developer since 2016. Most of this time I spent with Applover - a software agency.
  My role there has evolved a lot, from solely coding to leadership to business analysis. All those responsibilities took up varying portions of my time at various times.

  I was involved in quite a lot of different projects, with varying tech stacks, team structures, and domains.
  I listed some in the Projects section and I am always happy to share some insight into the others during the interview.

          Apart from working with a number of clients on various projects I worked on designing, implementing, and maintaining multiple processes used in day-to-day work, including:
          - Software development processes - git workflow, automation, quality metrics and requirements, analytics, definition of done, release checklist, etc.
          - Pre-development project processing - requirements discovery, system design workshops, specification crafting, team onboarding, kickoff checklist, etc.
          - Developer recruitment process - role requirements, 2-stage interview, loop meetings, tech onboarding

          A selection of noteworthy projects I've been involved with can be found listed under the Projects section of this resume
