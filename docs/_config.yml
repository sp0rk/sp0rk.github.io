          I watched and helped Applover grow from a team of a dozen to around 150 people. Apart from working with a number of clients on various projects I worked on designing, implementing, and maintaining multiple processes used in day-to-day work, including:
          - Software development processes - git workflow, automation, quality metrics and requirements, analytics, definition of done, release checklist, etc.
          - Pre-development project processing - requirements discovery, system design workshops, specification crafting, team onboarding, kickoff checklist, etc.
          - Developer recruitment process

          A selection of noteworthy projects I've been involved with can be found listed under the Projects section of this resume.
